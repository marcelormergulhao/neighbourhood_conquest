# Neighbourhood Conquest

## Introduction

The following project is a tool to help you find out how much of your own
neighbourhood you know!
It is set for my own neighbourhood at first, but I hope to evolve it soon and
be able to populate the list of places from a custom location.

## How to run it

Well, the project is a simple web page, so open "index.html" it in your browser
and check how it feels.
Soon I will add some backend to help maintain the new user data.
